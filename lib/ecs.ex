  Entity-Component-System (ECS) is a distributed and compositional architectural design pattern
  that is mostly used in game development. It enables flexible decoupling of domain-specific behaviour,
  which overcomes some of the drawbacks of traditional object-oriented inheritance.

  This was started as a pure copy of https://github.com/yosriady/ecs and taken
  from there. All initial credit goes to https://github.com/yosriady
